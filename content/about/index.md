I am a PhD student in the Department of Computer Science at the University of California, Irvine, advised by Professor Nalini Venkatasubramanian. My research focuses on Machine Learning Systems, Digital Twin technologies, and Distributed Systems optimization.

## Education

- PhD in Computer Science, University of California, Irvine (2023-Present)
- Master of Computer Science, California State University San Marcos (2020-2022)
- Bachelor of Mathematics, University of California, Santa Barbara (2015-2017)

## Research Interests

- Machine Learning Systems
- Digital Twin Technology
- Distributed Systems
- System Optimization

## Current Research

I am currently working on:
- Developing and architecting Digital Twins for disaster resilience
- Reducing communication overhead in Split Computing
- Implementing supervised compression techniques
- Developing progressive inference models

I also serve as a Graduate Student Mentor for the Zotbins Undergraduate Research Project, where I guide a team developing distributed smart waste bins to improve waste diversion rates through IoT and data analytics.
